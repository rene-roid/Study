// Methods are actions that we can perform.
// JavaScript has a number of string methods

// We call methos by appending an instance with:
// - a dot . (dot operator)
// - The name of the method
// Opening and closing parenthesis

console.log('wa soupp'.toLocaleUpperCase()) // Returns WA SOUPP
// As you can see  the .toUpperCase() method is called on the string 'wa soupp'
// The result is logged on the console in capital letters

// Here there is a list of all of the methods in JavaScript
